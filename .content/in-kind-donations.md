# How to donate materials instead of money

Sometimes you want to help but prefer giving actual supplies instead of cash. We understand that. Many people have construction materials, household items, or other supplies they can donate directly.

In-kind donations work well for this project because we need massive amounts of building materials and household goods. Your donations go straight to families who need them.

## What we need most right now

We're rebuilding entire villages. That means we need everything that goes into making a home:

### Construction materials

**Steel and iron**:

- TMT steel bars (8mm, 10mm, 12mm sizes)
- Steel pipes for water connections
- Iron sheets for temporary roofing
- Steel doors and window frames
- Reinforcement mesh for concrete

**Cement and concrete**:

- Portland cement (OPC 53 grade preferred)
- Ready-mix concrete for foundations
- Cement blocks and bricks
- Sand and gravel for mixing
- Waterproofing compounds

**Building supplies**:

- Red bricks (standard size)
- Hollow concrete blocks
- Roof tiles (clay or concrete)
- Insulation materials
- Paint and primers

### Electrical items and appliances

## How much we need (examples)

To give you an idea of scale, here's what it takes to rebuild one typical Punjab village home:

**For one 500 sq ft house**:

- 15 tons of cement
- 50 tons of bricks
- 2 tons of steel bars
- 500 sq ft of roofing material
- Complete electrical wiring kit
- Basic furniture set for 5 people
- Kitchen utensils for family cooking

**For 100 families in one village**:

- 1,500 tons of cement
- 5,000 tons of bricks
- 200 tons of steel
- 50,000 sq ft roofing
- 100 complete electrical systems
- 500 pieces of furniture
- 100 kitchen sets

These numbers show why in-kind donations matter so much. Buying all this retail would cost enormous amounts. But if suppliers and individuals donate materials, we can help many more families.

## Quality standards we follow

We can't accept just anything. Families deserve good quality materials that will last:

**Electrical items must be**:

- BIS approved for safety
- Come with warranty information
- Include installation manuals
- Be compatible with Indian voltage standards

**Household goods should be**:

- Clean and in working condition
- Suitable for rural family use
- Culturally appropriate for Punjab
- Durable enough for long-term use

## Items we cannot accept

Some things don't work for this project:

**Used construction materials**:
Safety concerns with structural items

**Old electrical appliances**:
Reliability issues in rural areas

**Clothing that's worn out**:
Dignity matters for flood victims

**Perishable food items**:
We focus on long-term rebuilding

**Furniture needing major repairs**:
Families need immediately usable items

## Making the biggest impact

Your in-kind donations work best when you:

- **Donate what we need most** (check our current needs list)
- **Give in useful quantities** (complete sets work better than random items)
- **Choose quality over quantity** (one good item beats five poor ones)
- **Coordinate with our team** (avoid duplicate donations)

Material donations create jobs too. Local workers unload trucks, sort items, and distribute supplies. Transportation creates work for drivers. Installation provides income for electricians and carpenters.

When you donate materials, you're not just giving supplies. You're helping rebuild an entire economy in flood-affected areas.

Every steel bar becomes part of a home. Every appliance brings comfort to a family. Every donation shows that people across India care about Punjab's recovery.

Your materials will be used wisely and with gratitude.
