# Why flood relief matters now

The floods that hit Punjab in August and September 2025 have created the worst disaster the state has seen since 1988. Over 354,000 people lost their homes. More than 1,400 villages are underwater. Families watched their entire lives wash away in muddy brown water.

This isn't just about numbers. It's about families sleeping on rooftops because their homes are flooded. Children who can't go to school. Farmers who lost everything they worked for. Elderly people stuck without medicine or clean water.

## What Global Sikhs is doing on the ground

Global Sikhs has been working in Punjab's villages for over 2 years. We don't just show up during disasters. We know these communities. We understand their needs.

Our teams are already in the flood zones. When families need help, we act.

We focus on three areas:

- **Immediate relief**: Food, clean water, medicine, and temporary shelter
- **Recovery support**: Helping families rebuild their homes and lives
- **Long-term planning**: Making sure communities are stronger when the next disaster hits

## How we manage operations

Here's how we operate:

**Ground teams**: Local volunteers who know every village and family
**Supply chain**: Direct partnerships with suppliers for materials and food
**Financial tracking**: Every rupee is tracked and reported to donors
**Regular updates**: Families get progress reports every 15 days

We use technology to stay connected. WhatsApp groups link our teams across different districts. GPS tracking shows exactly where supplies go. Photo documentation proves every project gets completed.

## Assessment criteria for selecting families

We don't help everyone the same way. Some families lost everything. Others need smaller support. We assess each situation carefully.

**Priority 1 - Complete loss families**:

- Home completely destroyed
- Lost all belongings and livestock
- No other source of income
- Elderly or disabled family members

**Priority 2 - Partial loss families**:

- Home damaged but repairable
- Lost some crops or livestock
- Have some family support available
- Can contribute to rebuilding efforts

**Priority 3 - Recovery support**:

- Minor damage to property
- Need help getting back to normal life
- Can benefit from skill training or small business support

## How we find these families

We don't wait for people to come to us. Our teams go village to village. They walk through flooded areas. They talk to sarpanches (village heads) and community leaders.

Local volunteers know which families need help most. They've lived in these villages their whole lives. They know who was struggling before the floods and who needs urgent help now.

We also work with other NGOs and government officials. But we make our own decisions about who gets help and how much.

## The real scale of this problem

Punjab produces 20% of India's wheat and 11% of its rice. These floods destroyed crops on 148,000 hectares of farmland. That's food that won't reach millions of tables across India.

But the human cost is bigger:

- 30,000+ families need new homes
- 200,000+ people lost their jobs
- 50,000+ children can't go to school
- 15,000+ elderly people need medical care

The government announced ₹1,600 crore in aid. That sounds like a lot. But it works out to about ₹50,000 per affected family. Try building a house with that amount.

## Our solution approach

We believe in building back better, not just rebuilding what was there.

**Immediate phase (0-3 months)**:

- Emergency food and shelter
- Medical care and clean water
- Temporary schools for children

**Recovery phase (3-12 months)**:

- Rebuild homes with flood-resistant designs
- Restore farmland and provide new seeds
- Set up temporary income sources

**Resilience phase (1-3 years)**:

- Train communities in disaster preparedness
- Build better drainage and water management
- Create alternative income sources

This isn't charity. It's investment in Punjab's future. When these families get back on their feet, they'll contribute to their communities again. Their children will go to school and build careers. The local economy will recover.

Every home we rebuild creates jobs for local workers. Every family we help becomes stronger and more prepared for future challenges.

The floods were devastating. But Punjab's spirit isn't broken. With the right support, these communities will come back stronger than before.
